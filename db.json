  "notes": "- We use (and love) [Sukrin Icing/Melis](https://www.amazon.com/Sukrin-Icing-Melis-Powdered-Substitute/dp/B00U7FCNG2/?tag=leaverou-20) for a healthy icing sugar substitute, it tastes exactly like the real thing and doesn't contain any artificial sweeteners, so it's keto-friendly (it's stevia & erythritol).\n- You can use 2 tbsp instant coffee if you don't have espresso, which is what the original recipe this one is forked from uses!\n- This will produce a delicate Grand Marnier flavor and the coffee will be fairly prominent. Adjust quantities accordingly if you want a stronger Grand Marnier flavor or less of a coffee flavor\n- If you're uncomfortable with raw eggs, you can buy pasteurized eggs or pasteurize them yourself by immersing the eggs in a 57.2C (135F) water bath for 75 minutes using a sous-vide (which is what we did).\n- Note that the amount of mixture this produces may be too much for your ice cream machine. We use a [Cuisinart ICE-21R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041A3KPC/?tag=leaverou-20) and we had to do it in 2 batches. But the mixture lasts well in the fridge, we did the second batch 3 days later and it was fine!",
